<article class="mention" data-context="aesthetics: an idea that sets humankind apart from other animal species. in the end of the day, burying the dead, laughter, and suicide are just the corollaries of a deep-seated hunch, the hunch that life is an aesthetic, ritualised, shaped form.art:general term describing a set of objects presented as part of a narrative known as art history. this narrative draws up the critical genealogy and discusses the issues raised by these objects, by way of three sub-sets: painting, sculpture, architecture.nowadays, the word “art” seems to be no more than a semantic leftover of this narrative, whose more accurate definition would read as follows: art is an activity consisting in producing relationships with the world with the help of signs, forms, actions and objects.my great success in finally confronting bourriaud’s relational aesthetics helped me approach another unread book in my shelf: michael chanan’s from printing to streaming: cultural production under capitalism. chanan’s book occupies a category that i tend to struggle with: the marxist theory–laden text, authored by by an anglophone artist–academic, about art under capitalism. (if a proust mention in the first 20 pages tends to motivate me onwards…then a karl marx and david harvey and theodor adorno and ludwig wittgenstein mention in the first 20 pages tends to repel me. and if mikhail bakhtin is cited as well? i might never open the book again.)but chanan’s from printing to streaming is a book of marxist cultural analysis for people who find such books particularly stifling. it helps that he takes an unobtrusively personal approach, by describing how his own professional trajectory maps onto the historical shifts he discusses. “when i first started teaching film,” he humorously observes, “i felt like an unemployed filmmaker employed to teach other people how to become unemployed filmmakers.” but when the uk launched the publicly owned channel 4 in the 1980s, chanan and other independent, avant-garde filmmakers were given an opportunity to produce ambitious work—and get paid for it. after a decade of documentary filmmaking, chanan returned to teaching.">

<article class="mention" data-context="a girl’s story (2016) is about a formative experience in ernaux’s adolescence, in the summer of 1958. she was one of the youngest and newest counselors at a summer camp, and after a sexual encounter with a popular, older counselor, she ends up rejected and mocked by the rest of the counselors. this is a genuinely difficult read—it describes the desperation to be desired, and how easy it is for young girls to be sexually manipulated and then shamed, in a very visceral way. but i think it’s poorly constructed (compared to her other memoir-y books, at least) and loses steam halfway through. as my friend nile noted, it feels like something she had to write—to grasp at some catharsis or self-acceptance—but it doesn’t feel very whole and integrated as a story.the possession (2022) is about ernaux’s all-consuming jealousy when a former lover (who she left, after 6 years together) begins a relationship with someone new: a 47 year old professor, divorced, with a young son. when the former lover tells ernaux this, she—burdened with these biographical details—becomes obsessed with learning more about this woman. what does she look like? where does she teach? what is her life like? “the strangest thing about jealousy,” ernaux writes, “is that it can populate an entire city—the whole world—with a person you may never have met.” if you are given to stalking your exes (or your ex’s exes, or your partner’s exes) on social media, this could be a very cathartic read! or if you liked vol. 5 and 6 of in search of lost time, which describe the protagonist’s obsessive, neurotic jealousy that his loved one might be seeing others. but i—despite being an exceptional, world-class ruminator—don’t really look people up on social media like that, so i couldn’t get into the possession! especially since there is much less about class, gender, and french history compared to her other books.">

<article class="mention" data-context="on painting. a recent newsletter from the critic and essayist @bdm convinced me to change my phone background to a florine stettheimer painting. (the monied buy her paintings from christie’s; the rest of us admire them in museums or on our screens). here’s a lovely essay from adam gopnick about the “luxury and ecstasy” of stettheimer’s seemingly ingenuous paintings:stettheimer’s deliberate simplification of drawing, her repetitive figure style, and her relentlessly additive, crowded compositions can at first evoke “outsider art.” but there are two types of outsider art, one made from below and one from above. there is the outsider who is, at first, indifferent to the possibility that money might be made from art, and then there is the outsider who needs to make no money from her art…stettheimer, like proust, her beloved literary hero, enjoyed the detachment provided by wealth, the luxury—shared by edith wharton, gerald murphy, and cole porter—of making what she wanted.if you want to read more about stettheimer, i also loved johanna fateman’s review of a stettheimer biography for 4columns.">
