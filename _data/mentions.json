This is a genuinely difficult read—it describes the desperation to be desired, and how easy it is for young girls to be sexually manipulated and then shamed, in a very visceral way. But I think it’s poorly constructed (compared to her other memoir-y books, at least) and loses steam halfway through.

When the former lover tells Ernaux this, she—burdened with these biographical details—becomes obsessed with learning more about this woman. What does she look like? Where does she teach? What is her life like? “The strangest thing about jealousy,” Ernaux writes, “is that it can populate an entire city—the whole world—with a person you may never have met.” If you are given to stalking your exes (or your ex’s exes, or your partner’s exes) on social media, this could be a very cathartic read! Or if you liked vol. 5 and 6 of <em>In Search of Lost Time</em>, which describe the protagonist’s obsessive, neurotic jealousy that his loved one might be seeing others. But I—despite being an exceptional, world-class ruminator—don’t really look people up on social media <em>like that</em>, so I couldn’t get into <em>The Possession!</em> Especially since there is much less about class, gender, and French history compared to her other books.</p></li>",

There is the outsider who is, at first, indifferent to the possibility that money might be made from art, and then <strong>there is the outsider who needs to make no money from her art…Stettheimer, like Proust, her beloved literary hero, enjoyed the detachment provided by wealth</strong>, the luxury—shared by Edith Wharton, Gerald Murphy, and Cole Porter—of making what she wanted.</p></blockquote>",

It wasn't easy, for I'd never suspected just how omnipresent are our own images. I began by merely avoiding mirrors, but by the end of the year I found myself with an acute knowledge of the reflected image, its numerous tricks and wiles, how it can spring up at any moment: a glass tabletop, a well-polished door handle, a darkened window, a pair of sunglasses, a restaurant's otherwise magnificent brass-plated coffee machine sitting innocently by the cash register. </p><p>At the time, I had just moved, alone, to Scotland and was surviving on the dole, as Britain's social security benefits are called. I didn't know anyone and had no idea how I was going to live, yet I went anyway because by happenstance I'd met a plastic surgeon there who said he could help me. I had been living in London, working temp jobs. While in London, I'd received more nasty comments about my face than I had in the previous three years, living in Iowa, New York, and Germany. These comments, all from men and all odiously sexual, hurt and disoriented me. I also had journeyed to Scotland because after more than a dozen operations in the States my insurance had run out, along with my hope that further operations could make any real difference. Here, however, was a surgeon who had some new techniques, and here, amazingly enough, was a government willing to foot the bill: I didn't feel I could pass up yet another chance to \"fix\" my face, which I confusedly thought concurrent with \"fixing\" my self, my soul, my life.</p></blockquote>",
